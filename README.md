# Project2

The Smart Document Analyzer project is designed with two key APIs to streamline the process of document analysis. The Secure File Uploader/Ingester API allows for easy and secure uploading of various document formats, including PDFs, images, and text files. Following the upload, the Text NLP Analysis API steps in to extract insights by identifying keywords, analyzing sentiment, and more, providing a deeper understanding of your documents. These APIs are the foundation of the project, crafted to enhance your document analysis experience. Dive into these APIs and discover how they can transform your document analysis tasks!
